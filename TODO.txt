Fix bug where when pausing and leaving with escape, you can't go back to the game
Make a better movement manager where rotate and base speed are passed down to movement orders without spaghetti code
There is a duplicate property : cooldown and time between each attacks for spellcard, must be cohesive
also fix shitty spell_bar code
